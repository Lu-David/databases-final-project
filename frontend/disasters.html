            We analyzed the impact of natural disasters on number of flight cancellations to airports in the same state as the natural disaster.
        We observe that the number of cancellations on average begin to increase in the days immeadiately preceeding and following date of recorded natural disaster.

        <p>
            We wanted to know which types of natural disasters had the biggest effect on number of cancellations recorded in our database.
        We observed that hurricanes have the biggest impact on cancellations. Toxic substances had the least.
