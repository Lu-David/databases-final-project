Contributing to the event were: 
-	The presence of water containing dissolved aluminum sulfate (alum) in the airplane fuel system that initiated a sudden blockage of the engine VSV TM SP filter. 
-	The maintenance provider omitted to sump the fuel tanks during the 10-day period of inactivity of the airplane.

Contributing to the combustion chamber failure was the operators' failure to do recommended borescope inspections that would have detected the combustion chamber distress and hence the removal of the engine before it was allowed to progress to the point that the combustion and turbine sections of the engine failed.","Aircraft - Aircraft power plant - Engine (turbine/turboprop) - Combustion section - Failure, Aircraft - Aircraft power plant - Engine (turbine/turboprop) - Combustion section - Not serviced/maintained, Aircraft - Aircraft power plant - Engine (turbine/turboprop) - Combustion section - Inadequate inspection, Personnel issues - Action/decision - Action - Lack of action - Maintenance personnel","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=90628"
